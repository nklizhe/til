Today I learned how to set a view's height by percentage of another view's height in Interface Builder. It's actually quite simple, but took me quite a while (and after Google Search) to figure it out. 

* Select two views and add the `Equal Heights` constraint
* Select the newly created constraint from the list on the left of IB
* Adjust the multiplier value on the right of IB
