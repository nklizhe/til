Today I learned how to automate the UI testing using [NSAccessibility](https://developer.apple.com/library/mac/documentation/AppKit/Reference/NSAccessibility_Protocol_Reference/) with the help of nice library [AppKitActor](https://github.com/miguellara/AppKitActor)

Example project: https://github.com/nklizhe/UIAutomationExample
